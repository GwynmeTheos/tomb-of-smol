# The Tomb of Smol
An amazing roguelike game written in Python 3.8. Take the sword and brave the tomb in search of riches.

## How to install

You will need:

- [Python 3.8.2](https://www.python.org/)
- [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)

### How to install Python 3.8.2

Go to the website and download the installer.

During the installation, watch out for a box that says `add Python to PATH variables`. Make sure that box is ticked, or you'll have issues. (See below how to add Python to PATH manually.)

Also make sure that that `pip` is being installed during the installation.

### How to install colorama

With Python in your PATH variables, now you also have `pip`. It's a package downloader.

Open CMD/Terminal, type in the following:

```pip install colorama```

Wait until it's done and rejoice.

### Starting the game

Download the zip file( or clone this repository).

Extract the zip to the desired folder.

Double-click on the `start.bat` file.

### [Optional] How to add Python to PATH manually

So, somewhere along the installation, you fucked up. Don't worry.

Windows 10 users will simply search `PATH` on the search barvon your task bar. [For other OS, Google how to access your PATH variables.]

Click on `Environment Variables`.

Select `Path` and click on `Edit`.

Locate your Python folder, usually on ...\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\...

Add the following folder locations to Path:
- ...\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\Scripts
- ...\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\
- ...\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\Scripts [This one only if you're having issues with colorama.]
